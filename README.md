# grrrrl

grrrrl is a project to compile tech talks by underrepresented communities in the technology industry.

The project is currently empty and needs a Homepage (`index.html`) where you can search and a Discover page where you can find cool videos (perhaps by topic?)

We want to curate a list of great videos, tag them and showcase them for all to find easily!
